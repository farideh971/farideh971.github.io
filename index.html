        <h1>Travel to Iran</h1>
        <p> Travel to Iran is fun. Go and explore it for yourself. Remember that
        <br>you have to be <strong>cautious</strong> since you have to keep <b>your mouth</b> shut 
          <br>at all time or you will pay for it.  
        </P>

        <h2>Iranian Nature</h2>
